# Spotify-data-extraction
This script enables you to obtain a list of all the music you've been listening to within a specified time frame(past 24 hours).

A spotify account is needed for this to work( well obviously, haha:)  )


Use this Link to generate your API token (https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-recently-played/?limit=&after=&before=)

NOTE!-API token expires after a few minutes, thus if the error "403  Insufficient client scope" is experienced when running the code, then a new API token needs to be regenerated)
